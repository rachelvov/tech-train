       "question    A previously healthy 14-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother because of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 6 hours. Over the past 6 weeks, she has also had increased frequency of urination, and she has been drinking more water than usual. She has lost 6 kg (13 lb) over the same time period despite having a good appetite. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. She appears lethargic. Physical examination shows deep and labored breathing and dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Urine dipstick is positive for ketones and glucose. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?\n",
